        POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION:

- Event listener to watch for a click on the start/play button
- Draw a full border around the timer
-Start counting down the timer;
- Each time the timer counts down, update the border
- Each time the timer counts down, update the text
- If we counted down and the timer reaches 0:
    - Reset the border
    - Reset internal timer to get ready for another run
